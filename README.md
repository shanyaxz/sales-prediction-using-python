Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.

# Description

Welcome to the Sales Prediction and Forecasting repository. This project is dedicated to predicting product sales by considering an array of influential factors, including advertising expenditure, audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, we aim to provide accurate sales forecasts to optimize business strategies.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named "advertising.csv." It's sourced from the ISLR (Introduction to Statistical Learning with R) repository. This dataset provides valuable insights into the relationship between advertising spending on television ('TV advertising') and product sales ('sales'). It's a fundamental resource for performing a simple linear regression analysis to understand how changes in TV advertising budgets impact sales.
